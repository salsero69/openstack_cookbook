You're more than welcome to pull the code and use it.  \r\n\r\nIf you're interested in adding some of your own scripts or have comments, critiques for the scripts that currently exist, please contact me.\r\n\r\nCurrently most of what's in here is based on DevStack pre-IceHouse release. So some of the scripts may break going forward.  As I learn more about OpenStack, I'm hoping to have an IceHouse release set of scripts that I can use consistently.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
