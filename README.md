openstack_cookbook
==================

This repository contains a number of scripts that I've written to make the management of OpenStack at the CLI level easier. 
I'm writing everything while learning Bash shell scripting and OpenStack, so bear with me.

Also note that the scripts are written based on the pre-icehouse devstack code.
